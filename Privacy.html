        <h1>HP Global Privacy Statement</h1>
        <p class="P1_lady">HP recognizes that privacy is a fundamental human right and further recognizes the importance of privacy, security and data protection to our customers and partners worldwide. As a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross international borders, we strive to provide protections across all our operations that exceed legal minimums and to deploy consistent, rigorous policies and procedures. As used in this statement, terms such as “we”, “us”,” our”, and “Company” refer to HP branded companies and current and future affiliates, as defined by local law (herein "HP"). Contact information for HP’s Data Protection Officer appears in the “Exercising Your Rights & Contacting Us” section below. </p>
        <p class="P2_lady">This Privacy Statement (sometimes known as Privacy Policy as prescribed by local law) informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make and rights you can exercise in relation to your personal data. This includes information that may be collected from your online activity, use of devices, and interactions you have with HP offline, such as when you engage with our customer support representatives. This Privacy Statement applies to all HP companies as well as HP-owned websites, domains, services (including device management), applications, subscriptions (i.e., Instant Ink) and products, and those of our subsidiaries (collectively “HP Services”), in the consumer context or while interacting with HP in the business-to-business customer context. For certain HP Services we may provide you with additional privacy information that supplements this Statement. Supplemental Statements for specific products and services can be found here. If you are located in the United States or in Mainland China, HP provides the Service to you under either the HP US Privacy Statement or the HP Mainland China Privacy Statement, accordingly. </p>
        <p class="P3_lady">This Privacy Statement does not apply to job candidates, HP employees or former employees as it does not cover employment-related data, nor to any personal data we process on behalf of our business customers when we provide services. The contracts we have with our business customers control how we process your personal data in this context. If you are a customer, employee, or contractor of one of HP’s business customers and have questions about your personal data we ask that you contact them and, if needed, HP will provide assistance to its HP business customers in responding to your questions.</p>
        <p class="P4_lady">Throughout this document references to ‘’local law” or “applicable law’’ refer to laws applicable to where you reside or where HP operates and processes personal data. </p>
